 **Improvements:**

1. **Aesthetics:** Improve the overall aesthetics of the websites by generating visually appealing HTML with embedded CSS.

2. **Code Generation:** Ensure that the code generated for the Flask applications does not include unnecessary or irrelevant code, such as code corresponding to SQLite in the case of the book review website.

3. **HTML Formatting:** Pay attention to the proper formatting of HTML files and ensure that they have the correct connections to the backend database, especially in the case of the German speaking website.

**Design for Video Editing Website:**

**HTML Files:**

1. `index.html`: This will be the homepage of the website and will provide an overview of the video editing services offered. It will include links to the different pages of the website, such as the pricing page, the contact page, and the login page.

2. `pricing.html`: This page will display the different pricing plans available for the video editing services. It will include a description of each plan, the features included, and the price.

3. `contact.html`: This page will provide a contact form for users to get in touch with the website owner. It will include fields for the user's name, email address, and message.

4. `login.html`: This page will allow users to log in to their accounts. It will include fields for the user's username and password.

5. `dashboard.html`: This page will be the user's dashboard after they have logged in. It will provide access to the different features of the website, such as uploading videos, editing videos, and sharing videos.

**Routes:**

1. `/`: This route will serve the `index.html` file.

2. `/pricing`: This route will serve the `pricing.html` file.

3. `/contact`: This route will serve the `contact.html` file.

4. `/login`: This route will serve the `login.html` file.

5. `/dashboard`: This route will serve the `dashboard.html` file.

6. `/upload-video`: This route will handle the uploading of videos to the website.

7. `/edit-video`: This route will handle the editing of videos on the website.

8. `/share-video`: This route will handle the sharing of videos on the website.

This is just a basic design for a Flask application for a video editing website. The actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements of the project.
